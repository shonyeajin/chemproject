              " Paragraph(id='wrapper', references=[], text='\\nAccess to clean and sustainable energy is of paramount importance for the development of human society. Typically, 60% of fossil energy is lost in waste heat. Today, various technologies have been proposed to harvest electricity from the largest energy source, the sun, but neither solar thermal plants nor photovoltaic power plants are that efficient and a large proportion of the solar radiation is lost in heat. Thus, several strategies are currently being explored beyond the use of heat engines in order to convert heat into electricity. One of these approaches is the thermoelectric generator (TEG).2,3 TEGs are defined as solid state devices that can convert heat (temperature differences) directly into electrical energy through a phenomenon called the Seebeck effect arising from the thermo-diffusion of electronic charge carriers in a material. The efficiency of a thermoelectric material is evaluated using a dimensionless quantity called the figure-of-merit, ZT = α2σT/κ, where α, σ, T and κ represent the Seebeck coefficient, the electrical conductivity, the absolute temperature and the thermal conductivity, respectively. Among the various types of material classes,3 organic electronic conducting polymers have attracted increased attention because they are based on abundant atomic elements and thus are potentially scalable at low cost. Despite the tremendous efforts and accomplishments of recent years,4–12 the efficiency of organic thermoelectric devices remains quite low because of their relatively small Seebeck coefficient. One possible strategy to increase the Seebeck coefficient of conducting polymers is to add solvent into the polymer to change its morphology.13 Whereas, another strategy is the addition of ionic thermodiffusion in mixed ionic-electronic conductors.14 Indeed, an ionic Seebeck contribution up to several hundreds of μV K−1 can be added to the electronic Seebeck coefficient. However, this effect vanishes with time because of the electronic reorganization. But if the electronic conducting paths are removed, for example, for pure ionic conductors, such as polystyrene sulfonic acid (PSSH), the ionic Seebeck coefficient was found to be extremely large and stable with time (∼a few mV K−1).15\\n'),\n",
              " Paragraph(id='wrapper', references=[], text='Recently, two classes of material have been explored for use in thermoelectricity: ionic conductors16–18 and electrolytes.19 A thermovoltage is developed in an ionic conductor submitted to a temperature difference because of the so-called Soret effect (thermodiffusion of ions). This new research area has been motivated by the use of the large ionic thermovoltage for example to (i) charge a SC leading to the so-called “ionic thermoelectric supercapacitors” (ITESCs)16 or (ii) to switch on/off transistors in “ionic thermoelectric transistors”.20 The ITESC is a single device comparable to an organic thermoelectric generator (OTEG) coupled in series with a supercapacitor (SC) of equivalent capacitance C. Importantly, because the ionic Seebeck coefficient of ionic conducting polymers (5 mV K−1)17 is about 100 times higher than the electronic Seebeck coefficient in electronic conducting polymers (50 μV K−1),4 the electrical energy E stored in an ITESC is 10000 times higher than in a SC coupled to an OTEG [E = 1/2C (αΔT)2]. A recent study shows that charging an ITESC can be compared with charging a TEG-SC based on the thermoelectric figure-of-merit ZT, which in the case of an ionic conductor implies that the electrical conductivity is solely because of ionic transport and the Seebeck coefficient is because of the thermodiffusion of ions.1 Interestingly, high ionic Seebeck coefficients were found for wet solid state polyelectrolytes such as polystyrene sulfonate sodium (PSSNa)1 and PSSH.17'),\n",
              " Paragraph(id='wrapper', references=[], text='Ideally the ionic thermoelectric material should be flexible, so that the ITESC is able to conform to the shape of any hot/cold objects (for example a pipe). Unfortunately polyelectrolytes are fragile and brittle. Also, making ionic thermoelectric materials robust would enable the use of a roll-to-roll machine for the production and assembly of the ITESC. ITESC and TEG are devices that produce a voltage proportional to the temperature difference. Thus, high voltage, i.e., high energy storage, is achievable if the material is thick and of low thermal conductivity. All these requirements need to be met as well as having a high ionic conductivity and high ionic Seebeck coefficient. One approach already demonstrated to strengthen the mechanical properties of materials is to make a composite with cellulose. Cellulose is attractive because it is a cheap, renewable and biodegradable material with good mechanical properties and is scalable for mass implementation.21 There have been many reports about fabricating composites with cellulose for use with electrical conductors for SC electrode,22 and electrolyte23 applications with excellent electronic and ionic conductivity.

But the difference in ionic conductivity between these two materials decreased with the increase of humidity, reaching a value of 9 and 12 mS cm−1 for NFC–PSSNa and PSSNa, respectively. Thus, in spite of the introduction of NFC, the ionic conductivity of NFC–PSSNa still remained high. The ionic conductivity in PSSNa increased exponentially with the percentage of humidity in the chamber but was saturated at high humidity levels. This saturation has been explained by the formation of water percolation channels at high humidity.32 Because the ionic conductivity in NFC–PSSNa is as high as that of PSSNa in a humid environment, the ionic transport also occurred in the water percolation paths, but the absence of saturation suggested that the presence of NFC modified the formation of these percolation water channels.'),\n",

Although it was difficult to measure the thermal conductivity under different humidity conditions by these methods, the effects of hydration were estimated by assuming that water entered the films in microdomains large enough to use an effective medium theory36,37 for the composite, in particular assuming that the water domains primarily separate the nanofibers, leading to parallel paths of thermal transport.

Typically, 60% of fossil energy is lost in waste heat. Today, various technologies have been proposed to harvest electricity from the largest energy source, the sun, but neither solar thermal plants nor photovoltaic power plants are that efficient and a large proportion of the solar radiation is lost in heat. Thus, several strategies are currently being explored beyond the use of heat engines in order to convert heat into electricity. One of these approaches is the thermoelectric generator (TEG).2,3 TEGs are defined as solid state devices that can convert heat (temperature differences) directly into electrical energy through a phenomenon called the Seebeck effect arising from the thermo-diffusion of electronic charge carriers in a material. The efficiency of a thermoelectric material is evaluated using a dimensionless quantity called the figure-of-merit, ZT = α2σT/κ, where α, σ, T and κ represent the Seebeck coefficient, the electrical conductivity, the absolute temperature and the thermal conductivity, respectively. Among the various types of material classes,3 organic electronic conducting polymers have attracted increased attention because they are based on abundant atomic elements and thus are potentially scalable at low cost. Despite the tremendous efforts and accomplishments of recent years,4–12 the efficiency of organic thermoelectric devices remains quite low because of their relatively small Seebeck coefficient. One possible strategy to increase the Seebeck coefficient of conducting polymers is to add solvent into the polymer to change its morphology.13 Whereas, another strategy is the addition of ionic thermodiffusion in mixed ionic-electronic conductors.14 Indeed, an ionic Seebeck contribution up to several hundreds of μV K−1 can be added to the electronic Seebeck coefficient. However, this effect vanishes with time because of the electronic reorganization. But if the electronic conducting paths are removed, for example, for pure ionic conductors, such as polystyrene sulfonic acid (PSSH), the ionic Seebeck coefficient was found to be extremely large and stable with time (∼a few mV K−1).15\\n'),\n",
              " Paragraph(id='wrapper', references=[], text='Recently, two classes of material have been explored for use in thermoelectricity: ionic conductors16–18 and electrolytes.19 A thermovoltage is developed in an ionic conductor submitted to a temperature difference because of the so-called Soret effect (thermodiffusion of ions). This new research area has been motivated by the use of the large ionic thermovoltage for example to (i) charge a SC leading to the so-called “ionic thermoelectric supercapacitors” (ITESCs)16 or (ii) to switch on/off transistors in “ionic thermoelectric transistors”.20 The ITESC is a single device comparable to an organic thermoelectric generator (OTEG) coupled in series with a supercapacitor (SC) of equivalent capacitance C. Importantly, because the ionic Seebeck coefficient of ionic conducting polymers (5 mV K−1)17 is about 100 times higher than the electronic Seebeck coefficient in electronic conducting polymers (50 μV K−1),4 the electrical energy E stored in an ITESC is 10000 times higher than in a SC coupled to an OTEG [E = 1/2C (αΔT)2]. A recent study shows that charging an ITESC can be compared with charging a TEG-SC based on the thermoelectric figure-of-merit ZT, which in the case of an ionic conductor implies that the electrical conductivity is solely because of ionic transport and the Seebeck coefficient is because of the thermodiffusion of ions.1 Interestingly, high ionic Seebeck coefficients were found for wet solid state polyelectrolytes such as polystyrene sulfonate sodium (PSSNa)1 and PSSH.17'),\n",
              " Paragraph(id='wrapper', references=[], text='Ideally the ionic thermoelectric material should be flexible, so that the ITESC is able to conform to the shape of any hot/cold objects (for example a pipe). Unfortunately polyelectrolytes are fragile and brittle. Also, making ionic thermoelectric materials robust would enable the use of a roll-to-roll machine for the production and assembly of the ITESC. ITESC and TEG are devices that produce a voltage proportional to the temperature difference. Thus, high voltage, i.e., high energy storage, is achievable if the material is thick and of low thermal conductivity. All these requirements need to be met as well as having a high ionic conductivity and high ionic Seebeck coefficient. One approach already demonstrated to strengthen the mechanical properties of materials is to make a composite with cellulose. Cellulose is attractive because it is a cheap, renewable and biodegradable material with good mechanical properties and is scalable for mass implementation.21 There have been many reports about fabricating composites with cellulose for use with electrical conductors for SC electrode,22 and electrolyte23 applications with excellent electronic and ionic conductivity.

But the difference in ionic conductivity between these two materials decreased with the increase of humidity, reaching a value of 9 and 12 mS cm−1 for NFC–PSSNa and PSSNa, respectively. Thus, in spite of the introduction of NFC, the ionic conductivity of NFC–PSSNa still remained high. The ionic conductivity in PSSNa increased exponentially with the percentage of humidity in the chamber but was saturated at high humidity levels. This saturation has been explained by the formation of water percolation channels at high humidity.32 Because the ionic conductivity in NFC–PSSNa is as high as that of PSSNa in a humid environment, the ionic transport also occurred in the water percolation paths, but the absence of saturation suggested that the presence of NFC modified the formation of these percolation water channels.'),\n",

              " Paragraph(id='wrapper', references=[], text='Although ions cannot pass through an external circuit as electrons can, heat could be converted to electrical energy using the concept of ITESC. The performance of ionic thermoelectric materials can be compared with electronic thermoelectrics because an ITESC of capacitance C corresponds to the equivalent circuit of a TEG connected in series with a SC of same capacitance (see the inset of Fig. 4b). It has been demonstrated that the charging efficiency of the ITESC was related to the traditional thermoelectric figure-of-merit including the ionic conductivity and the ionic Seebeck coefficient.1 Thus, the two relevant device quantities were calculated: the efficiency η and the energy stored E as a function of ZTi. As shown in Fig. 4a, the efficiency of the NFC–PSSNa composite was slightly better than that of pure PSSNa, although still much lower than that of commercial bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3) (ZT = 1) because of its relatively small ZTi. But for the comparison of energy transferred to the SC with same ΔT (10 K) and same capacitance (1 mF), the NFC–PSSNa composite performances were much better than those of pure PSSNa and around three orders higher than those with Bi2Te3, as shown in Fig. 4b. The energy transferred to the SC is shown quadratically by αi (E = 1/2CV2 = 1/2C(ΔTαi)2), and the αi of NFC–PSSNa is much larger than that of the PSSNa over the whole range of humidity.'),\n",

The introduction of nanofibers of cellulose led to a robust nanocomposite, not fragile nor brittle as was the pure polyelectrolyte. The thermoelectric properties of the paper composite were as good as the pure polyelectrolyte (ZTi = 0.025 at room temperature). The ionic conductivity of the composite was almost the same as that of pure PSSNa at high humidity and its Seebeck coefficient was higher than that of pure PSSNa. The fabrication of ionic thermoelectric paper opens up new possibilities in term of mass manufacturing of materials for large area ionic thermoelectric SCs. Those devices are designed to convert thermal energy from intermittent heat sources into stored electricity.\\n'),\n",
